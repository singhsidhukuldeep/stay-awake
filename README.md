Stay-Awake is a Simple Platform Independent Python package to keep your system awake without affecting workflow!

* Does this affect workflow? 
> No, this only get's triggered when you don't do any mouse movements!

* Is there a GUI?
> This was intended to be a light weight solution, so as of now it only has a CLI!

* How does it work?
> If in a span of 60 seconds you don't move your mouse, this script will automatically move your mouse for about 1 to 4 pixels randomly. There won't be any mouse displacement! If you are working, this will do absolutely nothing!



## Setup

### Installing Package
 
 ```shell
pip3 install stay-awake
 ```

### Running

```shell
python3 -m stay-awake
```

> You can also give custom timeouts
> Eg: for 5 minutes (default is 1 min) `python3 -m stay-awake 5`

**Important:** *Virtual Environment is recommended*


If getting issue in installing virtualenv on `windows`, use administrator privileges

## Steps for publishing to `pypi` [This is just for me, Maybe!]

- `pip3 install setuptools twine`
- Go to project folder
- `python3 setup.py sdist`

OR

Go to your project folder and:
